# Installing a client

[Many options](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/), so here's a couple:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

> very simple client, only most basic features

- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

> more features, fancy UI; free for _non-commercial_ use

- Your editor of choice

> many editors (Emacs, Atom, etc.) support version control from inside the editor

- The command line `r emo::ji('wink')`
]
